 * 274. H-Index My Submissions QuestionEditorial Solution
	Total Accepted: 34518 Total Submissions: 116432 Difficulty: Medium
	Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
	
	According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
	
	For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
	
	Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
	
	Hint:
	
	An easy approach is to sort the array first.
	What are the possible values of h-index?
	A faster approach is to use extra space.
