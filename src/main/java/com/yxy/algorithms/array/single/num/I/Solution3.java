/**
 * 	136. Single Number My Submissions Question
	Total Accepted: 109612 Total Submissions: 227843 Difficulty: Medium
	Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
	
	Note:
	Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
