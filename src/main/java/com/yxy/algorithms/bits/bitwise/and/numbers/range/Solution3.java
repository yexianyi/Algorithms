	Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.
	
	For example, given the range [5, 7], you should return 4.

	 * Basic idea:
	 * This algorithm is based on 2 regular patterns.
	 * 1. As long as there are different numbers in the same position for two numbers, then this position must by ZERO in the final result.
	 * 2. If the number of higher position is ZERO, then every position lower than it in the final result must be ZERO too. (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!)
	 * 3. Based on #1 and #2, this question has became looking for common prefix in M and N.
