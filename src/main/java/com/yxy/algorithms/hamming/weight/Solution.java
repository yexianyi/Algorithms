 * 	191. Number of 1 Bits My Submissions Question
	Total Accepted: 65561 Total Submissions: 173200 Difficulty: Easy
	Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
	
	For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.
